# bing bros
### why internet make sense when can dont?

## inspiration
you ever just read the news or browse reddit and wonder "what if this was a shitpost"? well wonder no more because
bing bros will make any website with images into a shitpost!

## what it do tho
replaces every image on the webpage with something similar from bing

## how make
we used an implementation of mobilenet trained on imagenet to classify all the images on a page. using these classifications, 
we then scrapped bing for a random image of that class to replace it with.

## what we're proud of
we bypassed paying for bing api by building our own 'api' to 'scrape' images from bing searches

## what we learned
literally any image from bing is a good shitpost
